<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This wretched note was the finale of Emma&apos;s breakfast. When once it had been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. The loss of the ball&#x2014;the loss of the young man&#x2014;and all that the young man might be feeling!&#x2014;It was too wretched!&#x2014;Such a delightful evening as it would have been!&#x2014;Every body so happy! and she and her partner the happiest!&#x2014;&quot;I said it would be so,&quot; was the only consolation. </p><p>Her father&apos;s feelings were quite distinct. He thought principally of Mrs. Churchill&apos;s illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and as for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but they would all be safer at home.</p></div> </div>
