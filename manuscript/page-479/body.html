<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging, my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole&apos;s; but I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better go home directly&#x2014;I would not have you out in a shower!&#x2014;We think she is the better for Highbury already. </p></div> </div>
