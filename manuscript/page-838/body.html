<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people of large fortune?&#x2014;You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr. Suckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me&#x2014;but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four horses.&quot;</p><p> &quot;The evil of the distance from Enscombe,&quot; said Mr. Weston, &quot;is, that Mrs. Churchill, asweunderstand, has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together. In Frank&apos;s last letter she complained, he said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle&apos;s! This, you know, speaks a great degree of weakness&#x2014;but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.&#x2014;So Frank writes word. </p></div> </div>
