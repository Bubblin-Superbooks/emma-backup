<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> With the greatest respect, and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.&#x2014;A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion, and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.&#x2014;My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.&#x2014;In order to assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.&#x2014;I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object&#x2014;but I am sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference, I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.&#x2014;Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me, was as much my conviction as my wish.&#x2014;She received my attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me. </p></div> </div>
