<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June, or say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before us. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for you, is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment&apos;s notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Excuse me, ma&apos;am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something&#x2014;Offices for the sale&#x2014;not quite of human flesh&#x2014;but of human intellect.&quot;</p></div> </div>
