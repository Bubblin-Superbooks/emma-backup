There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman&apos;s daughter, and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any body can do.&quot;</p></div> </div>
