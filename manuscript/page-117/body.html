<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Then, here come all my attempts at three of those four children;&#x2014;there they are, Henry and John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of them might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any of mama&apos;s children ever were. </p><p> Here is my sketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That&apos;s very like. I am rather proud of little George. </p></div> </div>
