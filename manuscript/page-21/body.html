Mr. Weston is such a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;&#x2014;and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?&quot;</p><p>&quot;A house of her own!&#x2014;But where is the advantage of a house of her own? This is three times as large.&#x2014;And you have never any odd humours, my dear.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!&#x2014;We shall be always meeting! <i>We</i> must begin; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon.&quot;</p><p>&quot;My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could not walk half so far.&quot;</p></div> </div>
