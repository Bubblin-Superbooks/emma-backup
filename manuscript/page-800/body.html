<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;I went only to the post-office,&quot; said she, &quot;and reached home before the rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters when I am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. A walk before breakfast does me good.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.&quot;</p><p>Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,</p><p> &quot;That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before. The post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. </p></div> </div>
