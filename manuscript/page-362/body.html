As to myself, I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings&#x2014;Nothing could be farther from my wishes&#x2014;your attachment to my friend Harriet&#x2014;your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent. </p></div> </div>
