<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days. He was often hoping, intending to come&#x2014;but was always prevented. His aunt could not bear to have him leave her. Such was his own account at Randall&apos;s. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill&apos;s removal to London had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. </p></div> </div>
