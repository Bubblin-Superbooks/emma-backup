<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so, upon the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. &apos;You <i>must</i><i>all</i> spend your evening with us,&apos; said she&#x2014;&apos;I positively must have you <i>all</i> come.&apos;&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?&quot;</p><p> &quot;No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I thought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him off, he did not;&#x2014;but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there, and a very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning&apos;s party. </p><p>&quot;Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been making up her mind the whole day?&quot;</p></div> </div>
