She was a beautiful creature when she came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have done very little.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If it were admissible to contradict a lady,&quot; said the gallant Mr. Elton&#x2014;</p><p>&quot;I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.&quot;</p></div> </div>
