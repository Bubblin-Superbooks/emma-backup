<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Don&apos;t say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is hotter to-day.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You are comfortable because you are under command.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your command?&#x2014;Yes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had, somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own management; but to-day you are got back again&#x2014;and as I cannot be always with you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine.&quot;</p></div> </div>
