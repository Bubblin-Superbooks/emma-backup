Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton, as elegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in silence&#x2014;wanting only to observe enough for Isabella&apos;s information&#x2014;but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could talk to her. </p><p>&quot;I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am sure you must have been wet.&#x2014;We scarcely got home in time. I hope you turned directly.&quot;</p></div> </div>
