<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The case is, you see, that the Campbells are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly. They had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so impatient to see them again&#x2014;for till she married, last October, she was never away from them so much as a week, which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother&#x2014;or her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but we shall see presently in Jane&apos;s letter&#x2014;wrote in Mr. Dixon&apos;s name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly, and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. </p></div> </div>
