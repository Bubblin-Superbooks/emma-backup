<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!&#x2014;I suppose you have heard&#x2014;and are come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in me&#x2014;(twinkling away a tear or two)&#x2014;but it will be very trying for us to part with her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadful headache just now, writing all the morning:&#x2014;such long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon. </p><p> &apos;My dear,&apos; said I, &apos;you will blind yourself&apos;&#x2014;for tears were in her eyes perpetually. One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great change; and though she is amazingly fortunate&#x2014;such a situation, I suppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first going out&#x2014;do not think us ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune&#x2014;(again dispersing her tears)&#x2014;but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache she has. </p></div> </div>
