<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,&quot; observed Mr. John Knightley coolly. &quot;But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; he takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any thing that home affords.&quot; </p></div> </div>
