<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.&#x2014;Oh! yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins&apos;s week&apos;s account; much rather, I confess.&#x2014;Pleasure in seeing dancing!&#x2014;not I, indeed&#x2014;I never look at it&#x2014;I do not know who does.&#x2014;Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward. </p></div> </div>
