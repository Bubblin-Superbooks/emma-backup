<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slight glance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next to Emma, Jane opposite to them&#x2014;and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them all; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little apparent observation. </p><p> The word was discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work. </p></div> </div>
