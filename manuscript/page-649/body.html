<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well; and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?&#x2014;I am so glad to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.&#x2014;Oh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so very happy to see her&#x2014;and now we are such a nice party, she cannot refuse.&#x2014;&apos;Aye, pray do,&apos; said Mr. Frank Churchill, &apos;Miss Woodhouse&apos;s opinion of the instrument will be worth having.&apos;&#x2014;But, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.&#x2014;&apos;Oh,&apos; said he, &apos;wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;&apos;&#x2014;For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of my mother&apos;s spectacles.&#x2014;The rivet came out, you know, this morning.&#x2014;So very obliging!&#x2014;For my mother had no use of her spectacles&#x2014;could not put them on. </p></div> </div>
