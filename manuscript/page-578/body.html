We have never been there above once since the new approach was made; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get there, you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again; and you had better name an early hour. </p><p>&quot;But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great many people talking at once. You will not like the noise.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But, my dear sir,&quot; cried Mr. Weston, &quot;if Emma comes away early, it will be breaking up the party.&quot;</p></div> </div>
