<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;How d&apos; ye do?&#x2014;how d&apos;ye do?&#x2014;Very well, I thank you. So obliged to you for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready for us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.&quot;</p><p>So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,</p><p>&quot;How is your niece, Miss Bates?&#x2014;I want to inquire after you all, but particularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?&#x2014;I hope she caught no cold last night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.&quot;</p></div> </div>
