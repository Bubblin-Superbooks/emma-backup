<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body invites their friends about them, and people think little of even the worst weather. I was snowed up at a friend&apos;s house once for a week. Nothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not get away till that very day se&apos;nnight.&quot; </p><p>Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but said only, coolly,</p><p>&quot;I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.&quot;</p><p>At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much astonished now at Mr. Elton&apos;s spirits for other feelings. Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.</p></div> </div>
