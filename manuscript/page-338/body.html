Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural, that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice towards <i>him</i>, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she owes nothing at all.&quot;</p></div> </div>
