<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Poor comfort!&quot; said Emma, laughing. &quot;One would rather have a stranger preferred than one&apos;s very particular friend&#x2014;with a stranger it might not recur again&#x2014;but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!&#x2014;Poor Mrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she really did not seem to feel it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So much the better&#x2014;or so much the worse:&#x2014;I do not know which. But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her&#x2014;quickness of friendship, or dulness of feeling&#x2014;there was one person, I think, who must have felt it: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction.&quot;</p></div> </div>
