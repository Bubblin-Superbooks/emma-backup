I trust, at least, that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,&quot; turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband. </p><p>&quot;Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley very far from looking well.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What is the matter, sir?&#x2014;Did you speak to me?&quot; cried Mr. John Knightley, hearing his own name.</p><p>&quot;I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking well&#x2014;but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before you left home.&quot;</p></div> </div>
