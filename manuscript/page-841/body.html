<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect&#x2014;but this is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank, and therefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of health now; but <i>that</i> indeed, by her own account, she has always been. I would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill&apos;s illness.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?&#x2014;To Bath, or to Clifton?&quot; &quot;She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for her. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She has now been a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she begins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very retired.&quot;</p></div> </div>
