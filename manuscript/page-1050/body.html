<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mr. Elton was called out of the room before tea, old John Abdy&apos;s son wanted to speak with him. Poor old John, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints&#x2014;I must go and see him to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. </p></div> </div>
