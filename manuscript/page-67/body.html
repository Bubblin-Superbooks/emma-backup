<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see&#x2014;one of our small eggs will not hurt you. </p><p> Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a little bit of tart&#x2014;a very little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the custard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to half a glass of wine? A small half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could disagree with you.&quot; </p></div> </div>
