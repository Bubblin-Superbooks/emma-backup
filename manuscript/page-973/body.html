<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is best observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well&#x2014;as you please; only don&apos;t have a great set out. And, by the bye, can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?&#x2014;Pray be sincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to inspect anything&#x2014;&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well&#x2014;but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely clever.&quot;</p></div> </div>
