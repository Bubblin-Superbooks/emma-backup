<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;You are very obliging.&#x2014;Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.&#x2014; He is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in a letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my son&apos;s hand, presumed to open it&#x2014;though it was not directed to me&#x2014;it was to Mrs. Weston. </p><p>&quot;And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr. Weston&#x2014;(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.&#x2014;A most dangerous precedent indeed!&#x2014;I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.&#x2014;Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, we married women must begin to exert ourselves!&#x2014;Oh! Mr. Weston, I could not have believed it of you!&quot;</p></div> </div>
