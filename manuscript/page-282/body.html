<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow? I have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling soon. He will be so pleased to see my little ones.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes, you had better let him look at little Bella&apos;s throat.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any uneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr. Wingfield&apos;s, which we have been applying at times ever since August.&quot;</p></div> </div>
