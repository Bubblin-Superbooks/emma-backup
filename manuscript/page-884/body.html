<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. &quot;I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!&#x2014;I believe we drive faster than any body.&#x2014;What a pleasure it is to send one&apos;s carriage for a friend!&#x2014;I understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary. </p><p> Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs. Weston&apos;s to receive them. Her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every body&apos;s words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire. </p></div> </div>
