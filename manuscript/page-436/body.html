<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean&#x2014;I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses&#x2014;and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them&#x2014;for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter&apos;s not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he had taken himself. </p></div> </div>
