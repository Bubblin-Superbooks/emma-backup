<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, simpleton as I was!&#x2014;but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was&#x2014;but had not resolution enough to part with them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?&#x2014;I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be useful.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I shall be happier to burn it,&quot; replied Harriet. &quot;It has a disagreeable look to me. I must get rid of every thing.&#x2014;There it goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.&quot;</p></div> </div>
