Delighted to hear it indeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage!&#x2014;excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the horses a moment. </p><p> Most comfortable carriage.&#x2014;Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.&#x2014;But two such offers in one day!&#x2014;Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, &apos;Upon my word, ma&apos;am&#x2014;.&apos; Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. </p></div> </div>
