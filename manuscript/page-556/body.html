We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you, than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a very strong proof.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Certainly&#x2014;very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger than, if <i>I</i> had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable to me. I could not excuse a man&apos;s having more music than love&#x2014;more ear than eye&#x2014;a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings.
