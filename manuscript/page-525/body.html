I remembered what I used to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in upon one&apos;s friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,&quot; said the young man, &quot;though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far; but in coming <i>home</i> I felt I might do any thing.&quot;</p></div> </div>
