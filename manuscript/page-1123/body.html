<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank Churchill? Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet&apos;s having some hope of a return? It darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself!. </p><p> Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same few minutes. She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before. How improperly had she been acting by Harriet! How inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been her conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her on! It struck her with dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world. </p></div> </div>
