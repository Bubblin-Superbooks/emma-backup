<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Circumstances that might swell to half an hour&apos;s relation, and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.&#x2014;The first, was his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came, and he had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from the rest to himself&#x2014;and at first, he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed!&#x2014;(Harriet could not recall it without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking her, whether her affections were engaged.&#x2014;But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them, he changed the subject, and began talking about farming:&#x2014;The second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of his being at Hartfield&#x2014;though, when he first came in, he had said that he could not stay five minutes&#x2014;and his having told her, during their conversation, that though he must go to London, it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all, which was much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to her. </p></div> </div>
