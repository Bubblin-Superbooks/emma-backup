<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity&#x2014;and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed. Let her marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard&apos;s all the rest of her life&#x2014;or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old writing-master&apos;s son.&quot; </p></div> </div>
