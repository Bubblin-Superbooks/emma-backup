<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys; but you have your sister&apos;s letter, and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise than her&apos;s, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I rather hope to satisfy you both,&quot; said Emma, &quot;for I shall do all in my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is very likely. You think so, do not you?&quot;</p></div> </div>
