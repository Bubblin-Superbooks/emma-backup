<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Emma&apos;s pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted; but on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her. Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting with her father.&#x2014;Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner decidedly graver than usual, said,</p><p>&quot;I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare, and therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend a few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say, besides the &apos;love,&apos; which nobody carries?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes&#x2014;rather&#x2014;I have been thinking of it some little time.&quot;</p></div> </div>
