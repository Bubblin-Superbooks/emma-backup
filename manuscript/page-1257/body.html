They seem not able to do any thing without him.&#x2014;&apos;Upon my word, Mr. E.,&apos; I often say, &apos;rather you than I.&#x2014;I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if I had half so many applicants.&apos;&#x2014;Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.&#x2014;I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight.&#x2014;However, he is coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all.&quot; And putting up her hand to screen her words from Emma&#x2014;&quot;A congratulatory visit, you know.&#x2014;Oh! yes, quite indispensable.&quot; </p><p>Miss Bates looked about her, so happily&#x2014;!</p></div> </div>
