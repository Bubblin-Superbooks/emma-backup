<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?&#x2014;I pity you.&#x2014;I thought you cleverer&#x2014;for, depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor word &apos;success,&apos; which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it. </p><p> You have drawn two pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third&#x2014;a something between the do-nothing and the do-all.
