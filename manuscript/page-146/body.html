That would have been too dreadful!&#x2014;What an escape!&#x2014;Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society. I must have given you up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dear me!&#x2014;How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more!&quot;</p></div> </div>
