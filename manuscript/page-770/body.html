<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration&#x2014;but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and befriend her.&#x2014;Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton&apos;s knight-errantry on the subject.&#x2014; </p><p> &quot;Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.&#x2014;I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.&#x2014;A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and ladylike&#x2014;and with such talents!&#x2014;I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. </p></div> </div>
