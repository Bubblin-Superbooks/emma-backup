<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Yes: but a young lady&#x2014;a bride&#x2014;I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible. It was being very deficient.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a <i>bride</i>? It ought to be no recommendation to <i>you</i>. It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady&#x2014;and a bride, especially, is never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to <i>her</i>. A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who they may.&quot;</p></div> </div>
