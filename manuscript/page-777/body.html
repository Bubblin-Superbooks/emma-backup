<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Poor Jane Fairfax!&quot;&#x2014;thought Emma.&#x2014;&quot;You have not deserved this. You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited!&#x2014;The kindness and protection of Mrs. Elton!&#x2014;&apos;Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.&apos; Heavens! Let me not suppose that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!&#x2014;But upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman&apos;s tongue!&quot;</p><p> Emma had not to listen to such paradings again&#x2014;to any so exclusively addressed to herself&#x2014;so disgustingly decorated with a &quot;dear Miss Woodhouse.&quot; The change on Mrs. Elton&apos;s side soon afterwards appeared, and she was left in peace&#x2014;neither forced to be the very particular friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton&apos;s guidance, the very active patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done. </p></div> </div>
