<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;I cannot rate her beauty as you do,&quot; said he; &quot;but she is a pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come,&quot; said he, &quot;you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you that you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl&apos;s giggle; she really does you credit.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may. <i>You</i> do not often overpower me with it.&quot;</p></div> </div>
