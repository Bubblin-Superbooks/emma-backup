<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband&apos;s house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always right in any man&apos;s eyes as I am in my father&apos;s.&quot; </p><p>&quot;But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly&#x2014;so satisfied&#x2014;so smiling&#x2014;so prosing&#x2014;so undistinguishing and unfastidious&#x2014;and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry to-morrow. But between <i>us</i>, I am convinced there never can be any likeness, except in being unmarried.&quot;</p></div> </div>
