Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.&#x2014;She never could have deserved him&#x2014;and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible. </p></div> </div>
