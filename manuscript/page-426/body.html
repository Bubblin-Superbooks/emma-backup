<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;My mother&apos;s deafness is very trifling you see&#x2014;just nothing at all. By only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over, she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me. </p><p> Jane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at my mother&apos;s time of life&#x2014;and it really is full two years, you know, since she was here. We never were so long without seeing her before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh yes; next week.&quot;</p></div> </div>
