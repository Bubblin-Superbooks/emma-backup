<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, that is (laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston, you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flatter myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. </p><p>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; said Jane earnestly, &quot;I cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when I am not here, by my grandmama&apos;s.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!&#x2014;And it is a kindness to employ our men.&quot;</p></div> </div>
