<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;I hope every body had a pleasant evening,&quot; said Mr. Woodhouse, in his quiet way. &quot;I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me. Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though she speaks rather too quick. </p><p> However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates too, in a different way. I like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed. She must have found the evening agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had Emma.&quot; </p><p>&quot;True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.&quot;</p></div> </div>
