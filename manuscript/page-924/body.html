<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last times we ever met in it!&#x2014;It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat&#x2014;just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came&#x2014;I think the very evening.&#x2014;Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?&#x2014;But, as you had none about you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he cut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before he gave it back to me. </p></div> </div>
