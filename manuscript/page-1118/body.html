<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demerits&#x2014;some concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense of justice by Harriet&#x2014;(there would be no need of compassion to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley&#x2014;but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even apparent kindness.&#x2014;For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet&apos;s hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained&#x2014;or to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her right.&#x2014;Rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.&#x2014;Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves. </p></div> </div>
