<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.&#x2014;Perry was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea&#x2014;a quarter of a mile off&#x2014;very comfortable. You should have consulted Perry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;&#x2014;only consider how great it would have been.&#x2014;An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.&quot;</p></div> </div>
