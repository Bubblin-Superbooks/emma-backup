<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so leniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man&#x2014;one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles&#x2014;Mr. Knightley. </p><p> The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment, he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand, &quot;Hum! just the trifling, silly fellow I took him for.&quot; She had half a mind to resent; but an instant&apos;s observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass. </p></div> </div>
