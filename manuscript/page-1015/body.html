<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively.&quot; They were laying themselves open to that very phrase&#x2014;and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another. Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected. </p><p>&quot;How much I am obliged to you,&quot; said he, &quot;for telling me to come to-day!&#x2014;If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that you were too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than you deserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded to come.&quot;</p></div> </div>
