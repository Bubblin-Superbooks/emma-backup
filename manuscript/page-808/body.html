<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well&#x2014;I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body. I can easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than to me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference, it is not age, but situation. </p><p> &quot;When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,&quot; said John Knightley, &quot;I meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle&#x2014;but that is not the change I had in view for you. </p></div> </div>
