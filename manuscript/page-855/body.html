<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Upon my word,&quot; exclaimed Emma, &quot;you amuse me! I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine&#x2014;what have they been? Dining once with the Coles&#x2014;and having a ball talked of, which never took place. </p><p> I can understand you&#x2014;(nodding at Mr. John Knightley)&#x2014;your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, I cannot imagine. </p></div> </div>
