<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.&quot;</p><p> &quot;Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is the eldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second, is named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I thought very pretty of her. </p><p> And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They are all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will come and stand by my chair, and say, &apos;Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?&apos; and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas. </p></div> </div>
