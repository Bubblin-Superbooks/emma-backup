<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles&#x2014;what she calls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deep enough in familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley&#x2014;what can she do for Mr. Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her. </p><p> Mrs. Weston, your argument weighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax&apos;s mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton&apos;s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding. </p></div> </div>
