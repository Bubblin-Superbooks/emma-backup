MY DEAR MADAM,</p><p> &quot;If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected; but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and indulgence.&#x2014;You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.&#x2014;But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent. </p></div> </div>
