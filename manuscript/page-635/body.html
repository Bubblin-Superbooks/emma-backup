<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always very long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.&#x2014;Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;&#x2014;Mr. Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the office-door, Mr. Cole&apos;s carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling children round the baker&apos;s little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door. </p></div> </div>
