They were off; and Emma could breathe.</p><p> &quot;Insufferable woman!&quot; was her immediate exclamation. &quot;Worse than I had supposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!&#x2014;I could not have believed it. Knightley!&#x2014;never seen him in her life before, and call him Knightley!&#x2014;and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her carosposo, and her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery. </p><p> Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether he will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. I could not have believed it! And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs. Weston!&#x2014;Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman! Worse and worse. </p></div> </div>
