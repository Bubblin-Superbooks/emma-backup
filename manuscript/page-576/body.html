However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.&quot; Then turning to Mrs. Weston, with a look of gentle reproach&#x2014;&quot;Ah!
