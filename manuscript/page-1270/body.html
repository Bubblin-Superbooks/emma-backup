<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;What an amiable creature I was!&#x2014;No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance.&quot;</p><p>&quot;&apos;Mr. Knightley.&apos;&#x2014;You always called me, &apos;Mr. Knightley;&apos; and, from habit, it has not so very formal a sound.&#x2014;And yet it is formal. I want you to call me something else, but I do not know what.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I remember once calling you &apos;George,&apos; in one of my amiable fits, about ten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as you made no objection, I never did it again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And cannot you call me &apos;George&apos; now?&quot;</p></div> </div>
