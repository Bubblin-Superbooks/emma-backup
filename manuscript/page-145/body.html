<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really almost made up my mind&#x2014;to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?&quot;</p><p> &quot;Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just what you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. </p><p>Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her forcibly.</p></div> </div>
