<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Gone to Mr. Woodhouse&apos;s. I made her take her shawl&#x2014;for the evenings are not warm&#x2014;her large new shawl&#x2014; Mrs. Dixon&apos;s wedding-present.&#x2014;So kind of her to think of my mother!

My dear Jane, are you sure you did not wet your feet?&#x2014;It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:&#x2014;but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely&#x2014;and there was a mat to step upon&#x2014;I shall never forget his extreme politeness.&#x2014;Oh! Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you my mother&apos;s spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet never came out again. </p></div> </div>
