<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me.&#x2014;Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.&#x2014;What was to be done?&#x2014;One thing only.&#x2014;I must speak to my uncle. Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.&#x2014;I spoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened away his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man! with a deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.&#x2014;I felt that it would be of a different sort.&#x2014;Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him, for my suspense while all was at stake?&#x2014;No; do not pity me till I reached Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her. </p></div> </div>
