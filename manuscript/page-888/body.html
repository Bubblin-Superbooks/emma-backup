<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> My mother often talks of your good-nature. Does not she, Jane?&#x2014;Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?&#x2014;Ah! here&apos;s Miss Woodhouse.&#x2014;Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?&#x2014;Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite in fairy-land!&#x2014;Such a transformation!&#x2014;Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma most complacently)&#x2014;that would be rude&#x2014;but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse, you do look&#x2014;how do you like Jane&apos;s hair?&#x2014;You are a judge.&#x2014;She did it all herself. </p><p> Quite wonderful how she does her hair!&#x2014;No hairdresser from London I think could.&#x2014;Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare&#x2014;and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.&#x2014;How do you do? How do you do?&#x2014;Very well, I thank you. This is delightful, is not it?&#x2014;Where&apos;s dear Mr. Richard?&#x2014;Oh! there he is. </p></div> </div>
