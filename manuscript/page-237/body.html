<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman&apos;s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now; or with no important variation. </p><p> If I draw less, I shall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for objects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the great point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much, to care about. </p></div> </div>
