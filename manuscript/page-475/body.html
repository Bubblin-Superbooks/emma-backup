For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs. Cole&apos;s note&#x2014;no, it cannot be more than five&#x2014;or at least ten&#x2014;for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come out&#x2014;I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork&#x2014;Jane was standing in the passage&#x2014;were not you, Jane?&#x2014;for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough. </p><p> So I said I would go down and see, and Jane said, &apos;Shall I go down instead? for I think you have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.&apos;&#x2014;&apos;Oh! my dear,&apos; said I&#x2014;well, and just then came the note.
