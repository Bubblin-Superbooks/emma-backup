Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was beginning to hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away&#x2014;and then&#x2014;only think!&#x2014;I found he was coming up towards me too&#x2014;slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and so he came and spoke, and I answered&#x2014;and I stood for a minute, feeling dreadfully, you know, one can&apos;t tell how; and then I took courage, and said it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I was going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole&apos;s stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain. </p></div> </div>
