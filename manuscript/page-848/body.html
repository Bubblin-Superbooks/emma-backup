<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;I hope,&quot; said he presently, &quot;I have not been severe upon poor Mrs. Churchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid to her. </p><p> She was the instigator. Frank&apos;s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride is nothing to his wife&apos;s: his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her pride is arrogance and insolence! And what inclines one less to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood. </p></div> </div>
