Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be&#x2014;for we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.&#x2014;However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.&#x2014;I shall certainly have her very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation. </p></div> </div>
