<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose&#x2014; Indeed I am not so mad.&#x2014;But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance&#x2014;and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so proper, in me especially.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart.&quot;</p></div> </div>
