<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr. Elton, papa,&#x2014;I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him&#x2014;and he has been here a whole year, and has fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him single any longer&#x2014;and I thought when he was joining their hands to-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing him a service.&quot; </p></div> </div>
