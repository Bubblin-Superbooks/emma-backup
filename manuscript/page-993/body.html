<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley and Harriet!&#x2014;It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was glad to see it.&#x2014;There had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, and turned from her with little ceremony. </p><p> Now they seemed in pleasant conversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now she feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in blossom, and light column of smoke ascending.&#x2014;She joined them at the wall, and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around. </p></div> </div>
