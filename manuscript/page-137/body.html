<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse him. If she can hesitate as to &apos;Yes,&apos; she ought to say &apos;No&apos; directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings, with half a heart. </p><p>&quot;Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to&#x2014;but if you would just advise me what I had best do&#x2014;No, no, I do not mean that&#x2014;As you say, one&apos;s mind ought to be quite made up&#x2014;One should not be hesitating&#x2014;It is a very serious thing.&#x2014;It will be safer to say &apos;No,&apos; perhaps.&#x2014;Do you think I had better say &apos;No?&apos;&quot;</p></div> </div>
