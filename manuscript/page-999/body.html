Harriet&apos;s sweet easy temper will not mind it.&quot;</p><p> He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came back all the better&#x2014;grown quite cool&#x2014;and, with good manners, like himself&#x2014;able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in their employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so late. </p><p>&quot;As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,&quot; said he. &quot;I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my sketches, some time or other, to look at&#x2014;or my tour to read&#x2014;or my poem. I shall do something to expose myself.&quot;</p></div> </div>
