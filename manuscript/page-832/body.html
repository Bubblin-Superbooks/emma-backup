<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!&#x2014;Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!&#x2014;what a dear creature he is;&#x2014;I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all that quaint, old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease; modern ease often disgusts me. </p><p> But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown. How do you like it?&#x2014;Selina&apos;s choice&#x2014;handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed&#x2014;quite a horror of finery. </p></div> </div>
