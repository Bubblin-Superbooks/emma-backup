She thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. She talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection&#x2014;but she had too much to urge for Emma&apos;s attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston ended with, &quot;We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come,&quot; she was obliged to pause before she answered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for. </p><p>&quot;Are you well, my Emma?&quot; was Mrs. Weston&apos;s parting question.</p></div> </div>
