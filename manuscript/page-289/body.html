<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Mr. Perry,&quot; said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, &quot;would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it any business of his, to wonder at what I do?&#x2014;at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?&#x2014;I may be allowed, I hope, the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.&#x2014;I want his directions no more than his drugs.&quot; He paused&#x2014;and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only sarcastic dryness, &quot;If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.&quot; </p></div> </div>
