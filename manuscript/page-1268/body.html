<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Do you?&#x2014;I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:&#x2014;Miss Taylor gave you principles. You must have done well. My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, what right has he to lecture me?&#x2014;and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. </p><p> I do not believe I did you any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much without doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.&quot; </p></div> </div>
