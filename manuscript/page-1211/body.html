She must tell you herself what she is&#x2014;yet not by word, for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.&#x2014;Since I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from her.&#x2014;She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never complains, I dare not depend. </p><p> I want to have your opinion of her looks. I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit. Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you without delay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness or misery. </p></div> </div>
