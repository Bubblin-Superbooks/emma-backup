Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of being sometimes alone!&quot;&#x2014;seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her, even towards some of those who loved her best. </p><p>&quot;Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!&quot; said Emma, as she turned back into the hall again. &quot;I do pity you.
