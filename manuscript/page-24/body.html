<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Dear Emma bears every thing so well,&quot; said her father. &quot;But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am sure she <i>will</i> miss her more than she thinks for.&quot;</p><p> Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. &quot;It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,&quot; said Mr. Knightley. &quot;We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor&apos;s advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor&apos;s time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. </p></div> </div>
