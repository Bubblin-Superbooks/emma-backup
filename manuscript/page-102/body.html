<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm. With all dear Emma&apos;s little faults, she is an excellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred times.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella. John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children. I am sure of having their opinions with me.&quot;</p></div> </div>
