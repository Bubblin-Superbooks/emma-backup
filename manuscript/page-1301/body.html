<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma&apos;s feelings, and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet&apos;s side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis, &quot;No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,&quot; that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature. </p><p>&quot;Do you dare say this?&quot; cried Mr. Knightley. &quot;Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?&#x2014;What do you deserve?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are?&quot;</p></div> </div>
