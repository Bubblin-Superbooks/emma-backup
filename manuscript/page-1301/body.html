My friend Robert could not resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremely amused; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day&#x2014;which he did&#x2014;and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in vain.&#x2014;She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is deserving. </p></div> </div>
