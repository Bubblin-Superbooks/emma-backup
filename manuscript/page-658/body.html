<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> William Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see him. But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of that sort his master had; he had brought them all&#x2014;and now his master had not one left to bake or boil. </p><p> William did not seem to mind it himself, he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his master&apos;s profit than any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent away. She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple-tart this spring. </p></div> </div>
