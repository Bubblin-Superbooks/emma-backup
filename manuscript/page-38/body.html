<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew him any attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day. That will be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,&quot; said Mr. Knightley, laughing, &quot;and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better thing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.&quot;</p></div> </div>
