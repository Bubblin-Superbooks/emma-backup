But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any body, that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;May I, indeed?&#x2014;Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so well. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set. Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly, warm-hearted woman. I like them all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You know Miss Fairfax&apos;s situation in life, I conclude; what she is destined to be?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes&#x2014;(rather hesitatingly)&#x2014;I believe I do.&quot;</p></div> </div>
