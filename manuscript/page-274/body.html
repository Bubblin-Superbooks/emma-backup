I never had much opinion of the sea air.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir&#x2014;or we should not have gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly for the weakness in little Bella&apos;s throat,&#x2014;both sea air and bathing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use to any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.&quot;</p></div> </div>
