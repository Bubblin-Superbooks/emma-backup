I perfectly remember it.&#x2014;Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, was not he? I have an idea he was standing just here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.&#x2014;It is very odd, but I cannot recollect.&#x2014;Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I am now.&quot;&#x2014;</p><p>&quot;Well, go on.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh! that&apos;s all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say&#x2014;except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to see me do it.&quot;</p></div> </div>
