<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the question: and I do <i>not</i> wish to see any such person. I would rather not be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to marry, I must expect to repent it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dear me!&#x2014;it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!&quot;&#x2014;</p><p> &quot;I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a situation as mine. </p></div> </div>
