<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always a sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!&#x2014;and the air so bad!&quot;</p><p> &quot;No, indeed&#x2014;we are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London is very superior to most others!&#x2014;You must not confound us with London in general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;&#x2014;there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in: but we are so remarkably airy!&#x2014;Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.&quot; </p></div> </div>
