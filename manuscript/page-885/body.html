<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;So very obliging of you!&#x2014;No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares&#x2014;Well!&#x2014;(as soon as she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!&#x2014;This is admirable!&#x2014;Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could not have imagined it.&#x2014;So well lighted up!&#x2014;Jane, Jane, look!&#x2014;did you ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin&apos;s lamp. </p><p> Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her as I came in; she was standing in the entrance. &apos;Oh! Mrs. Stokes,&apos; said I&#x2014;but I had not time for more.&quot; She was now met by Mrs. Weston.&#x2014;&quot;Very well, I thank you, ma&apos;am. I hope you are quite well. </p></div> </div>
