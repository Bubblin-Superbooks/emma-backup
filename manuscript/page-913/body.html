It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.&#x2014;She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was peculiarly gratifying. </p><p> The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward to another happy result&#x2014;the cure of Harriet&apos;s infatuation.&#x2014;From Harriet&apos;s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom, she had strong hopes. </p></div> </div>
