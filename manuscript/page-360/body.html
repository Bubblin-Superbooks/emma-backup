<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Good Heaven!&quot; cried Mr. Elton, &quot;what can be the meaning of this?&#x2014;Miss Smith!&#x2014;I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence&#x2014;never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she has fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very sorry&#x2014;extremely sorry&#x2014;But, Miss Smith, indeed!&#x2014;Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my honour, there is no unsteadiness of character. </p><p> I have thought only of you. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannot really, seriously, doubt it. No!&#x2014;(in an accent meant to be insinuating)&#x2014;I am sure you have seen and understood me.&quot; </p></div> </div>
