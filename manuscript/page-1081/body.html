<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill&apos;s decease, Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who &quot;could not stay five minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her.&quot;&#x2014;He met her at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,</p><p>&quot;Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?&#x2014;Do, if it be possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is she unwell?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, no, not at all&#x2014;only a little agitated. She would have ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you <i>alone</i>, and that you know&#x2014;(nodding towards her father)&#x2014;Humph!&#x2014;Can you come?&quot;</p></div> </div>
