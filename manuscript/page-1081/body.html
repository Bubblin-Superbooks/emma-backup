<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation, that Emma&apos;s uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she eagerly said,</p><p>&quot;What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I find, has occurred;&#x2014;do let me know directly what it is. I have been walking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense. Do not let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your distress, whatever it may be.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Have you indeed no idea?&quot; said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice. &quot;Cannot you, my dear Emma&#x2014;cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear?&quot;</p><p>&quot;So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.&quot;</p></div> </div>
