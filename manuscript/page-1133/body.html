Every moment had brought a fresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her.&#x2014;How to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself, and living under!&#x2014;The blunders, the blindness of her own head and heart!&#x2014;she sat still, she walked about, she tried her own room, she tried the shrubbery&#x2014;in every place, every posture, she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness. </p></div> </div>
