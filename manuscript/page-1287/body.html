<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mr. Elton cared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped &quot;the young lady&apos;s pride would now be contented;&quot; and supposed &quot;she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could;&quot; and, on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, &quot;Rather he than I!&quot;&#x2014;But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.&#x2014;&quot;Poor Knightley! poor fellow!&#x2014;sad business for him.&quot;&#x2014;She was extremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good qualities.&#x2014;How could he be so taken in?&#x2014;Did not think him at all in love&#x2014;not in the least.&#x2014;Poor Knightley!&#x2014;There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him.&#x2014;How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over now.&#x2014;Poor fellow!&#x2014;No more exploring parties to Donwell made for her. </p></div> </div>
