<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome, the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.&#x2014;To Emma&apos;s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley&apos;s, whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.&#x2014;They had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most serviceable light&#x2014;first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one&#x2014;well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse&apos;s mind.&#x2014;It was agreed upon, as what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or other&#x2014;in another year or two, perhaps&#x2014;it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place. </p></div> </div>
