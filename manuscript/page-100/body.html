<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;I either depend more upon Emma&apos;s good sense than you do, or am more anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance. How well she looked last night!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma&apos;s being pretty.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether&#x2014;face and figure?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial old friend.&quot;</p></div> </div>
