Warmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all the clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will. It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved&#x2014;which gives Isabella all her popularity.&#x2014;I have it not&#x2014;but I know how to prize and respect it.&#x2014;Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives. </p><p> Dear Harriet!&#x2014;I would not change you for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female breathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!&#x2014;Harriet is worth a hundred such&#x2014;And for a wife&#x2014;a sensible man&apos;s wife&#x2014;it is invaluable. I mention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!&quot; </p></div> </div>
