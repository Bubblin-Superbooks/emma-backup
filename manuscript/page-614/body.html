<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not the least idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?&#x2014;He is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond of his brother&apos;s children. </p><p>&quot;My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax&#x2014;&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I am sure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but&#x2014;&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Mrs. Weston, laughing, &quot;perhaps the greatest good he could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.&quot;</p></div> </div>
