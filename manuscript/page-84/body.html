<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer&apos;s daughter, without education.&quot; </p><p> &quot;To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education&#x2014;and been very well brought up. However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against yours&#x2014;and I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife. </p></div> </div>
