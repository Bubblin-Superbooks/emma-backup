<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.&quot;</p><p>&quot;By the bye&#x2014;I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you all behave? Who cried most?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah! poor Miss Taylor! &apos;Tis a sad business.&quot;</p></div> </div>
