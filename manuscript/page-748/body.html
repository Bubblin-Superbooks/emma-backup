From Harriet&apos;s happening not to be at Hartfield, and her father&apos;s being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarter of an hour of the lady&apos;s conversation to herself, and could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and thinking much of her own importance; that she meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living; that if not foolish she was ignorant, and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good. </p></div> </div>
