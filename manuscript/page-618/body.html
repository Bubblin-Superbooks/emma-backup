<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not want the match&#x2014;I do not want to injure dear little Henry&#x2014;but the idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry&apos;s account, a boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.&#x2014;Mr. Knightley marry!&#x2014;No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt it now. And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But the imprudence of such a match!&quot;</p></div> </div>
