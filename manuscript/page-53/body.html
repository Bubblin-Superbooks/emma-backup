<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School&#x2014;not of a seminary, or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality, upon new principles and new systems&#x2014;and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity&#x2014;but a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. </p><p> Mrs. Goddard&apos;s school was in high repute&#x2014;and very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands. </p></div> </div>
