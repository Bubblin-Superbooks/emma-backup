Very odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning, and the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Donwell!&quot; cried his wife.&#x2014;&quot;My dear Mr. E., you have not been to Donwell!&#x2014;You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.&quot;</p><p> &quot;No, no, that&apos;s to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to-day on that very account.&#x2014;Such a dreadful broiling morning!&#x2014;I went over the fields too&#x2014;(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,) which made it so much the worse. And then not to find him at home! I assure you I am not at all pleased. </p></div> </div>
