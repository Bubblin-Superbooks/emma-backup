<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? (turning to Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?&#x2014;I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, (with a smile at his father). </p><p>&quot;And make her like myself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;By all means, if you can.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming wife.&quot;</p><p>&quot;She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else. I shall go abroad for a couple of years&#x2014;and when I return, I shall come to you for my wife. Remember.&quot;</p></div> </div>
