Whether he were overhearing too, she could not determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself&#x2014;and it was, &quot;How do you like my gown?&#x2014;How do you like my trimming?&#x2014;How has Wright done my hair?&quot;&#x2014;with many other relative questions, all answered with patient politeness. </p></div> </div>
