<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte&#x2014;a very elegant looking instrument&#x2014;not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and explanations on Miss Bates&apos;s, was, that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood&apos;s the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece&#x2014;entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates&apos;s account, Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it&#x2014;but now, they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter;&#x2014;of course it must be from Colonel Campbell. </p></div> </div>
