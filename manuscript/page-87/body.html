<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton&apos;s manners are superior to Mr. Knightley&apos;s or Mr. Weston&apos;s. They have more gentleness. They might be more safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in him, because there is so much good-humour with it&#x2014;but that would not do to be copied. </p><p> Neither would Mr. Knightley&apos;s downright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits him very well; his figure, and look, and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model. </p></div> </div>
