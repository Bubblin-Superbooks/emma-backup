<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As the blow was given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had to tell. &quot;She had set out from Mrs. Goddard&apos;s half an hour ago&#x2014;she had been afraid it would rain&#x2014;she had been afraid it would pour down every moment&#x2014;but she thought she might get to Hartfield first&#x2014;she had hurried on as fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she would just step in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain, and she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as she could, and took shelter at Ford&apos;s.&quot;&#x2014;Ford&apos;s was the principal woollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher&apos;s shop united; the shop first in size and fashion in the place.&#x2014;&quot;And so, there she had set, without an idea of any thing in the world, full ten minutes, perhaps&#x2014;when, all of a sudden, who should come in&#x2014;to be sure it was so very odd!&#x2014;but they always dealt at Ford&apos;s&#x2014;who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her brother!&#x2014;Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. </p></div> </div>
