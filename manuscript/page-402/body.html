<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr. Frank Churchill&apos;s not coming, except as a disappointment at Randalls. The acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self, she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston&apos;s disappointment, as might naturally belong to their friendship. </p></div> </div>
