<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr. Knightley!&#x2014;How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!&#x2014;But Harriet was less humble, had fewer scruples than formerly.&#x2014;Her inferiority, whether of mind or situation, seemed little felt.&#x2014;She had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton&apos;s being to stoop in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr. Knightley&apos;s.&#x2014;Alas! was not that her own doing too? Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?&#x2014;Who but herself had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible, and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?&#x2014;If Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too. </p></div> </div>
