Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh!&#x2014;you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me himself. I met him just now. He told me it was to be a great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you, but he said you knew it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What did Mr. Weston tell you?&quot;&#x2014;said Emma, still perplexed.</p><p>&quot;Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while.
