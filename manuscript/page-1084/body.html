Good Heavens!&#x2014;What can be to be <i>broke</i> to me, that does not relate to one of that family?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Upon my honour,&quot; said he very seriously, &quot;it does not. It is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of Knightley.&quot;</p><p>Emma&apos;s courage returned, and she walked on.</p><p> &quot;I was wrong,&quot; he continued, &quot;in talking of its being broke to you. I should not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern you&#x2014;it concerns only myself,&#x2014;that is, we hope.&#x2014;Humph!&#x2014;In short, my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. </p></div> </div>
