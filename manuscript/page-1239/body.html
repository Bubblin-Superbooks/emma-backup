Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her&#x2014;and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.&#x2014;When it was thus settled on her sister&apos;s side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.&#x2014;Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse&apos;s carriage.&#x2014;It was all arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square. </p></div> </div>
