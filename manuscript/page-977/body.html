Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me&#x2014;Jane and her aunt.&#x2014;The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting the Hartfield family. Don&apos;t scruple. I know you are attached to them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home.&quot;</p></div> </div>
