<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma&apos;s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people.&quot;</p><p>&quot;My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns&#x2014;my winter walk.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You cannot do better, sir.&quot;</p></div> </div>
