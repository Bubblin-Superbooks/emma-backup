An old married man&#x2014;quite good for nothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?&quot;</p><p>&quot;With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot. Come, Jane, take my other arm.&quot;</p><p> Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off. &quot;Happy couple!&quot; said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of hearing:&#x2014;&quot;How well they suit one another!&#x2014;Very lucky&#x2014;marrying as they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!&#x2014;They only knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!&#x2014;for as to any real knowledge of a person&apos;s disposition that Bath, or any public place, can give&#x2014;it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. </p></div> </div>
