He looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,</p><p>&quot;Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?&#x2014;Emma, I had not thought it possible.&quot;</p><p>Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.</p><p>&quot;Nay, how could I help saying what I did?&#x2014;Nobody could have helped it. It was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me.&quot;</p></div> </div>
