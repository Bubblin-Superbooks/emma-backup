<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;There, papa!&#x2014;Now you must be satisfied&#x2014;Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who is carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many years ago, when I had the measles? &apos;If <i>Miss</i><i>Taylor</i> undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.&apos; How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!&quot;</p><p> &quot;Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor little Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would have been very bad, but for Perry&apos;s great attention. He came four times a day for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good sort&#x2014;which was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint. </p></div> </div>
