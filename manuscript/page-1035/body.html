<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Were she your equal in situation&#x2014;but, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case. She is poor; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to old age, must probably sink more. Her situation should secure your compassion. It was badly done, indeed! You, whom she had known from an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at her, humble her&#x2014;and before her niece, too&#x2014;and before others, many of whom (certainly some,) would be entirely guided by your treatment of her.&#x2014;This is not pleasant to you, Emma&#x2014;and it is very far from pleasant to me; but I must, I will,&#x2014;I will tell you truths while I can; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now.&quot; </p></div> </div>
