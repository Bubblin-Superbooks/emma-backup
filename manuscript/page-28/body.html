<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;I do not understand what you mean by &apos;success,&apos;&quot; said Mr. Knightley. &quot;Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady&apos;s mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, &apos;I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her,&apos; and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and that is all that can be said.&quot; </p></div> </div>
