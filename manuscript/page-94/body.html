<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old. I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through&#x2014;and very good lists they were&#x2014;very well chosen, and very neatly arranged&#x2014;sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. </p><p> The list she drew up when only fourteen&#x2014;I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma. </p></div> </div>
