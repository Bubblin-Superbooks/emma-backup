How do you do, Mr. Richard?&#x2014;I saw you the other day as you rode through the town&#x2014;Mrs. Otway, I protest!&#x2014;and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.&#x2014;Such a host of friends!&#x2014;and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!&#x2014;How do you do? How do you all do?&#x2014;Quite well, I am much obliged to you. </p><p> Never better.&#x2014;Don&apos;t I hear another carriage?&#x2014;Who can this be?&#x2014;very likely the worthy Coles.&#x2014;Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about among such friends! And such a noble fire!&#x2014;I am quite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for me&#x2014;never take coffee.&#x2014;A little tea if you please, sir, by and bye,&#x2014;no hurry&#x2014;Oh! here it comes. </p></div> </div>
