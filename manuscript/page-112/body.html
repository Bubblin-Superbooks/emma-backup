<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Let me entreat you,&quot; cried Mr. Elton; &quot;it would indeed be a delight! Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?&quot;</p><p> Yes, good man!&#x2014;thought Emma&#x2014;but what has all that to do with taking likenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don&apos;t pretend to be in raptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet&apos;s face. &quot;Well, if you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try what I can do. </p></div> </div>
