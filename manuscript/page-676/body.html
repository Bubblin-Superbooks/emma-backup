<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Well, I am so sorry!&#x2014;Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party last night; how extremely pleasant.&#x2014;Did you ever see such dancing?&#x2014;Was not it delightful?&#x2014;Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never saw any thing equal to it.&quot;</p><p> &quot;Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes. And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance player, without exception, in England. </p><p>&quot;Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence&#x2014;so shocked!&#x2014;Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What is the matter now?&quot;</p></div> </div>
